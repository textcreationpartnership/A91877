            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE paſſing of thoſe long expected <hi>Reſolves</hi> of this High Court for the <hi>Engliſhing</hi> both of our Lawes and Proceedings in all Courts of Juſtice; for abrogating the ſo call'd, <hi>Court-hand,</hi> which to moſt People did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differ from exorciſticall Characters, ſave that the former was truly miſchievous to them, the latter for the moſt part but imaginary; For nullifying <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> Offices, &amp; retrenching <hi>unneceſſary</hi> Fees; for the <hi>expediting</hi> of Cauſes, and purſuing certaine directions concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> hath emboldned me to preſent unto your Wiſdom theſe few conſiderations hereunto annexed: for which, and what elſe I have tranſgreſſed in the like kind, I ſhall only vſe this ſhort Apologie; That, as I have to ſome been known to caſt in my little mite, concerning many, if not moſt matters of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick debate, not ſo much out of confidence of my own ſtrength, as ſincerity of heart, and for provoking others of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abilities to improve them: ſo in this, towards the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of our Lawes and Law-proceedings, which if not ſpeedily brought about, may like enough, take root again, and ſettle firmer upon their old corrupt foundation, which muſt neceſſarily contract ſuch farther rottenneſs &amp; feſtering, as wil at firſt infect, &amp; afterwards, too ſoon, make void and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate all thoſe Glorious <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Diſcoveries,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:165763:3"/>
wee have attained to with the charge of ſo much <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure,</hi> for redeeming them out of the jaws of <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> &amp; <hi>Tyranny:</hi> may <hi>You</hi> then but be prevailed upon ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſecure what <hi>We</hi> have ſo dearly paid for: <hi>We</hi> muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly back again into <hi>our</hi> wonted <hi>bondage</hi> (which on ſuch as have had their eyes opened, would fall more grievous) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the whole <hi>Myſterie</hi> of the <hi>Judiciary</hi> faculty, and of all thoſe that relate unto it, be fully diſcovered, and ſet at rights.</p>
            <p>I beſeech <hi>You</hi> conſider, <hi>They</hi> are an <hi>Active</hi> generation, ſo that if well <hi>regulated,</hi> the Nation may be as happy in them, as otherwiſe <hi>We</hi> muſt be again more miſerable.</p>
            <p>May <hi>You</hi> then pleaſe to let it be enquired into; Whether the <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of Courts of Juſtice do not cauſ a more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous confuſion in the World, than the <hi>Babilonian</hi> of Languages? That of <hi>Babel</hi> doth only eſtrang Nations to one another; but this variety of Courts of Juſtice in any Land or Nation, perplexes and confounds the People thereof among themſelves; The proceedings in them are ſo various, as that it is above any one mans ability and ſtrength to be experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in more than one of them: So many ſeverall <hi>Courts,</hi> ſo many ſeverall hard <hi>Myſteries</hi> or <hi>Trades,</hi> above one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no man though of the ableſt parts, can be well skill'd in or practiced: And from henc proceeds it in part, that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits becom both more laſting and chargeable: Particularly, to what purpoſe ſerved the Kings Prerogative Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, one of the moſt eminent badges of Conqueſt and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Surely all Courts ſhould be the Common-wealths in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and every mans in particular: Juſtice ſhould not know any diſtinction of perſons, but be ſtill one and the ſame in all Courts alike, whether as touching the letter of the Law, or Equity: But for ſooth, they were all called the Kings Courts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; And indeed we had little but what was our Kings, Wee had nothing of our own; ſo gracious were they, and ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:165763:3"/>
have we been: But our Kings boar ſway enough in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> they needed not have had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Court of their own to doe Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>Beſides; Our Lawes of themſelves are ſo numerous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, as that it is not poſſible to know them all, much leſſe keep them in memory, or avoyd the being entangled by them, and injured by Law: Nay, I am afraid it may be found, that never ſuch Jugling, if not very cheating, was conſiſtent with the rules of any Faculty, as of this I ſpeak, and is at preſent practiced in <hi>England:</hi> How els comes it to paſſe that a man may dwell in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and yet be ſued unto an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary before he know of it? How comes it els to paſs that an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor may be forced to pay as long as he hath Aſſetts, and yet afterwards be forced to pay the ſame ſums over again, becauſe hee could not keep himſelf from being forced to pay them away before? In brief, how comes it els to paſs that a Debitor may keep his Creditor in priſon untill he be compelled to give him a diſcharg, or yeeld to whatſoever he deſires? I only wiſh that ſome honeſt publique ſpirited Lawyer who throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the various Meanders, Quirks and ſubtilties of this over-powring Faculty, would anatomize, and lay open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nation, how eaſily it is for the very beſt Lawes wee have to be evaded and fruſtrated, and the whole formality and proceedings to be avoyded and deluded by <hi>legall</hi> fallacies and tricks.</p>
            <p>I am confident our whole body of Lawes, even in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall conſtitution, will be found to be ſo purely the Offspring of Oppreſſion, and Oppreſſors Creatures, and in themſelves ſo weak and fruitleſſe, as to the eſtating and continuing of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Peace, plenty, and Contentation, that the Law, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cuſtome of the Turks, is to be preferred before it, where he that will give moſt, ſhall be ſure to have the right determined on his ſide; only, becauſe the wronged party is quickly out of
<pb facs="tcp:165763:4"/>
pain, and in a ſhort time knowes what he has to truſt to:</p>
            <p>But for our own Lawes, which ſome notwithſtanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before all the world's, becauſe they never well underſtood their own, much leſs thoſe of other Countries, though corrupt enough in moſt; They are ſuch a forraginous peece of Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſuch a vanity to becom a Rule unto ſo famous a Nation; ſuch a <hi>Noſe of wax,</hi> lyable to be formed any way for the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a People; as that if the very memory thereof, and the Formalities of their proceedings were quite extinct, never to preſent themſelves again unto our Imaginations, and thereby the Nation forced to ſeek out both new Lawes and Forms; wee could not happen upon ſo bad again; Nay, wee were likelier to light upon far better than any Nation enjoyes at preſent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe well neer all Nations, though ſome more, ſome leſs, lye under oppreſſion, and cannot procure to themſelves, ſuch as they deſire, nor the <hi>equall</hi> adminiſtration of thoſe they have.</p>
            <p>I did not intend to have been ſo tedious, &amp; therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave to inſert a word concerning our Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Maintenance</hi> &amp; <hi>Champarty,</hi> whereby the purchaſing of Titles from perſons not in poſſeſſion, have been ſo ſpeciouſly prohibited, as the only way to prevent diſquieting, vexing, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, and finall diſinheriting of the true Proprietors: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly We may find the quite contrary effect to have enſued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and poor People by force of theſe Statutes been neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to loſe their titles, becauſe they might not gratifie ſuch as would have been willing to furniſh them with moneys to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and recover their Rights.</p>
            <p>What good effect have we ſeen at any time to poor People ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in forma pauperis?</hi> If the higheſt vyer can <hi>protract,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſway</hi> Cauſes as they pleaſe, againſt others of moderate, though inferiour eſtates and friends unto themſelves; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no crums of relief, much leſs of diſpatch, will be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be caſt away to <hi>Paupers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165763:4"/>
May we but have ſpeedy juſtice at home in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and large charges to ſuch as ſhall be found unduly ſued; we need not prohibit poor People, to ſell or give away one halfe of their right, for recovering of the other: Men will look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they leap, and conſider well before they adventure upon bad titles, or diſturb any man in poſſeſſion, unleſs they ſee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence to bear them out therein: It would be a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold better for the Nation, even under theſe Laws we live at preſent, ſo far forth to repeal thoſe Statutes concerning Mayntenance &amp; Champarty, and render all men in poſſeſſion lyable to have their Titles queſtioned; than to leave poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple remediles; In regard ſuch poor People thus oppreſſed are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred for one, who by ſuch repeal would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be unduly moleſted.</p>
            <p>But if the Reformation of the Lawes ſeem great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and by ſo much longer before it can be brought about: We may notwithſtanding be happy in due time, If it be but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly begun to be ſet upon at preſent; and in the Interim, with leſs diſadvantage patiently expect the compleating thereof, If the <hi>County Regiſter</hi> of Conveyances mentioned in the ſame dayes <hi>Reſolves,</hi> together with another Regiſter of Bonds and Bills of debt, with their Irrevocable aſſignableneſſe to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, (whereof I have a modell not exceeding one ſheet of paper, nor requiring many hours debate, ready to be produced whenſoever this High Court ſhall be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it unto a Committee, to be proceeded on) were forth-with eſtabliſhed: Both the ſaid Regiſters carrying in themſelves a capacity to abbreviat &amp; prevent the greateſt part of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and Cavils; and the latter not only to multiply the ſtock of the Nation, which at preſent is at ſo low an ebb, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly facilitate and enlarg Trade and Navigation.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould be accounted unworthy, or unadviſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in this great affair, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> beſides it's being obnoxious
<pb facs="tcp:165763:5"/>
to other objections, might perhaps at firſt appearance be thought very dammageable unto the conſcientious learned Judges and Counſellors: In caſe this High Court in their deep Wiſdom ſhall think of a Reformation, whether according to this little modell in all humility propounded, or any other, which, I wiſh might be of a hundred fold more advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Nation; It is in Your power to conſtitute and aſſign ſuch worthy Judges and Counſellors in every County through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, with the very ſame ſtipends, or greater than they enjoy at preſent; <hi>Praemio &amp; paena floret Reſpublica:</hi> It were better to be profuſe in rewarding perſons of deſert in what kind ſoever, than to be ſhort therein.</p>
            <p>And ſince the pittance is ſo ſmal, which can any wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me in this Common-wealth's proſperity, I hope I ſhall be thought free from all ſelf-Intereſts, and only to have engaged my ſelfe in matters of this high Nature out of a Publique ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſs, and to make the beſt Improvement of my only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent how ſmall ſoever, to the beſt advantage of this Nation wherein Providence hath caſt me.</p>
            <p>There now remayns only this humble Motion, That the High Court of Parliament if in their deep Wiſdoms They ſee cauſ, vouchſafe to refer the conſideration of this little Paper unto the Committee mentioned in the ſaid Reſolves, for whoſe happy proceedings thereupon, or otherwiſe, in purſuance of the ſaid Reſolves,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Propounder and the whole Nation will be bound to pray,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And if any thing Materiall be alleadged and proved, by this contradictory debate which did not before appear, the Judg is to Order it to be put in Writing, and Entred with the other proceedings, notifying the parties thereof.</p>
               <p>And in caſe one party refuſe to appear before the Judg, for thus arguing of the buſineſſe, in contradictory, he is not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>And if the party condemned appeal before execution be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then muſt he, in whoſe favour the Judgment was, deſiring execution, firſt put in ſufficient ſecurity to ſtand to ſuch farther judgment, as the Court, to which the appeal is made, ſhall think good to paſſe, to be entred with the reſt of the proceedings, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not.</p>
               <p>The Appeallant therefore is to Enter his appeal in writing, to be kept with the other proceedings, where the Judgment was given; and that Judg, or his Clerk is forth-with to give him a Copy thereof under his hand, as alſo of the whole proceedings, or of ſo much as is deſired, ſo ſoon as it can conveniently be made, which the Appeallant is to tranſmit unto the Court of the Shire-Town, where it is to be admitted upon the Appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants putting in ſufficient ſecurity unto the Court of the Shire-Town, that he will effectually proſecute the ſaid Appeal within eight dayes following, and be lyable to ſuch Charges, penalty, and otherwiſe, as that Court ſhall condemn him in, in caſe hee be found to have appealed unduely.</p>
               <p>And it ſhal be likewiſe lawful for both parties to appeal from one and the ſame Judgment in ſuch part thereof as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend themſelves agrieved, and proſecute the ſame in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as aforeſaid; and the Shire-Court in ſuch caſe obliged to obſerve the ſame Orders concerning Fines and Charges as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>This being done, and the appeal admitted, notification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be made unto the party, in whoſe favour the Judgment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:165763:9"/>
was graunted, in the Hundred-Court, who is to anſwer to this appeal in the Shire-Court; and the whole proceedings, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to be framed as aforeſaid, in the Hundred-Court.</p>
               <p>And if nothing more Materiall be alleadged and proved, than what was before in the Hundred Court; If the Judg of the Shire Court ſhall ſee good to confirm the ſaid Judgment of the Hundred Court, hee is likewiſe obliged to condemn the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peallant in all manner of Charges, and one ſixth part more then the buſineſſe in controverſie amounted to, by way of penalty, to the uſe of him that had both Judgments in favour, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution forthwith to be had accordingly.</p>
               <p>But if no new matter being alleadged and proved, the Judg of the Shire Court ſhall ſee cauſe to reverſe the Judgment of the Hundred Court, in the whole or in part, the Defendant in the Shire Court is not to be condemned in Charges disburſed ſince the Appeal to the ſaid Court; but the Judg of the Hundred Court, for his unjuſt, or erroneous Judgment, is to be fined ſo much, as the Charges of both parties, in the Shire Court, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to, and ſo much more as the full Dammages of the Appeallant will any ways amount to, with ſpeedy execution as aboveſaid.</p>
               <p>And in caſe new matter be alleadged, and proved, for which cauſe the Judgment happens to be altered in part, or in the whole, than the Defendant is not to be condemned in Charges, nor the Hundred Judge in any Fine, ſo far as the new matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, and proved, was cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>And if the Judg or Judges of the Shire Court ſhall paſs unjuſt or erroneous judgment, ſuch judgment ſhall notwithſtanding be valid, ultimate, and binding, in reſpect to the parties litigant, and have ſudden execution both againſt body and goods of the party condemned, without putting in ſecurity, as was before required.</p>
               <p>And if either, or both parties find themſelves agrieved, it ſhall be lawful for them, or either of them to addres themſelves unto the <hi>Parliament,</hi> againſt ſuch Judg or Judges of the Shire Court, who hereby are made accomptable, and lyable to be condemned in all manner of Dammages, coſt and charges, ſuch party or parties complaining againſt them, ſhall have ſuffered through

their unjuſt erroneous Judgment, be put by their Office, and ſuffer ſuch other puniſhment, as the Juſtice and wiſdome of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> think good to inflict upon them.</p>
               <p>But if any perſon ſhall be found to have without cauſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed from the Shire Court, and unjuſtly to have accuſed the Judg, or Judges thereof in <hi>Parliament,</hi> then ſhall the ſaid Judg or Judges be abſolved.</p>
               <p>And ſuch perſon be lyable to be condemned by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in the ſame penalties, which he required, by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to be inflicted on the ſaid Judg, or Judges, and ſudden execution to be granted, to the uſe and benefit of the ſaid Judg or Judges only, together with their full Charges to be rated by authority of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all other Charges to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rated by the reſpective Courts, where Judgment was given for payment of them.</p>
               <p>The Judg, or Judges of the Diviſion or Shire Court are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged hereby, if either of the parties deſire it, to draw out the motives in brief, which ſwayed them in giving ſuch judgment, to remaine upon Record, together with the Proceſſe; and ſo ſoone as any ſuit is fully ended, whether in the Hundred, or Shire Court, all papers and proceedings are to be made up by themſelves, and bound together with others orderly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the date of the Judgment, in as great a Volume as is well manageable, with an Alphabet at the end thereof, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the names both of the Plaintiffs and Defendants.</p>
